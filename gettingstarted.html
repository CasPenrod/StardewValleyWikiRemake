                                one
                                tile at a

                                kitchen sink,
                                after getting your first house upgrade.

                                Crops need to be watered every day. Crops that are not watered will not die, but they
                                will
                                not grow
                                either.

                                The best times to upgrade the watering can are the day before it is predicted to rain,
                                as
                                the rain
                                will water the crops, or the 27th day of the season after watering any crops that are
                                expected to
                                ripen on the 28th. The Blacksmith will need 2 days to upgrade any tools, including the
                                watering can.

                                Sprinklers, which must be crafted and placed, will automatically water surrounding tiles

                                increasing number of surrounding tiles, starting with 4 tiles (immediately adjacent to

                                2:00AM, they'll wake up in the morning with their energy level about half restored.

                                On Multiplayer, lying in bed will regain energy over time.

                                The Spa will fully restore energy over a short period of time.</p>
