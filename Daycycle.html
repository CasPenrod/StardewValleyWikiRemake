                            <p>The day cycle is a period of 20 hours in-game from 6am to 2am in which the player
                                (farmer) is
                                able to
                                work
                                and perform other activities around the Valley. The player will always wake up at the
                                same time
                                every
                                day,
                                but they are able to choose to go to bed whenever they like, which in turn ends the day.

                            <hr>
                            <p>The main effects of the day cycle on the player character are the processes of sleeping
                                and saving
                                that
                                happen overnight. The player may choose to go to bed at any hour to sleep and progress
                                time to the
                                morning
                                of the next day. This is done by moving into the area inside of any bed, and a dialogue
                                will prompt
                                them
                                to
                                confirm the decision. However as a reminder, as time passes midnight (12:00 am) the
                                player's
                                character
                                will
                                show that they are tired and in need of sleep.</p>
                            <p>Sleep will restore the player's Energy and Health to full if they go to bed no later than
                                midnight
                                and
                                are
                                not exhausted, and to half if they pass out or are exhausted. The longer past midnight
                                the player
                                stays
                                awake, the less energy they wake up with, with about 75% restored if they sleep at 1am,
                                and 50% if
                                they
                                sleep right before 2am. Regardless of when the player sleeps, there will be no further
                                impact on the
                                next
                                day â€“ the player will wake up and become active at 6am as usual, even if they stay up
                                late.
                                Therefore
                                even
                                though the day will go on until 2am, there is no requirement to stay awake for the whole
                                day;
                                conversely
                                there is also no immediate need to sleep as soon as the clock turns to midnight.</p>

                            <p>The game saves only after the player has gone to sleep and the daily profit breakdown has
                                been
                                accepted,
                                signaling the start of a new day.</p>

                            <p>In multiplayer, it is possible to "nap" during the daytime when positioned inside a bed.
                                The player
                                will
                                slowly regain energy as time passes, like at the Spa. Additionally, the chat will
                                announce when a
                                player
                                tucks into bed for the first time and confirms that they want to end the day. There will
                                be no
                                additional
                                messages if they choose to get up out of bed and later return to bed. Finally, note that
                                in
                                multiplayer,
                                all
                                players must sleep (or pass out) to progress to the overnight profit breakdown, and all
                                players must
                                also
                                confirm the start of the next day to save. When in bed, a dialogue will indicate how
                                many other
                                players
                                are
                                also waiting to end the day.</p>
                            <h4>Passing Out</h4>
                            <p>The player can stay awake until 2am, after which their character will pass out. This
                                means the player
                                is
                                unable to be active after 2am, even if they have energy remaining. If the character
                                passes out
                                outside
                                their
                                Farmhouse or Cabin, they will wake up in bed, having been dragged there by either a
                                JojaMart medical
                                team,
                                Linus, Marlon, or Dr. Harvey if they are not married to him. In each case 10% of the
                                player's money,
                                up
                                to a
                                maximum of Gold.png1,000g (or Gold.png2,500g in the Volcano Dungeon), will be lost. The
                                details of
                                this
                                transaction will appear as a letter in the player's mailbox the next day, although Linus
                                does not
                                count
                                the
                                money lost (the amount is still stored in the save file). There is no penalty for
                                falling asleep
                                while
                                inside a Farmhouse or Cabin. In a multiplayer game, any player that passes out will be
                                announced in
                                chat,
                                even if they are inside the farmhouse.</p>

                            <h4>Darkness</h4>
                            <p>Depending on the season, nightfall is at different times. In spring and summer, it is
                                8pm, while in
                                fall
                                it
                                is
                                at 7pm and winter is 6pm. At nightfall, the background noise may change, and indoors the

                                lamps and sconces light up. Indoor locations also become dark at night (unless fully lit
                                by light
                                sources),

                                if nightfall happens while you are indoors it stays light until you exit and re-enter.
                                At night
                                outdoors, it
                                does not immediately become full dark, but gradually becomes darker over time.</p>

                            <h4>Villagers and locations</h4>
                            <p>Villagers will move to different locations around the Valley depending on the time,
                                combined with
                                some
                                additional influence from days of the week. The time of day also affects what locations
                                are open,
                                including
                                shops according to their Shop Schedules. For example, most locations in Pelican Town
                                generally open
                                at
                                9am.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Fishing</h4>
                            <p>Certain fish only appear at certain times of the day. For example, it is considered
                                nighttime after
                                6pm,
                                which
                                makes it possible to catch some nighttime fish. However as an aside, it does not become
                                dark until
                                around
                                8pm,
                                depending on the season. Other specific fish might only be active at certain hours
                                during the
                                daytime,
                                such
                                as a
                                period during the morning or afternoon.</p>

                            <h4>Animals</h4>
                            <p>Animal livestock (Cows, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, ducks and rabbits) will leave their
                                buildings
                                at
                                the
                                start
                                of the day if it is possible to do so (the weather is sunny and the building's animal
                                door is left
                                open).
                                This
                                allows them to eat grass. In the evening they will return to the building to sleep.
                                These animals will attempt to go inside their coop or barn at 5pm on their own, and will
                                start going
                                to
                                sleep at
                                7pm, and will stop moving around the building by themselves at 8pm. After that time they
                                will settle
                                down
                                and
                                stay in one place. They normally cannot be interacted with while they are asleep, making
                                it
                                impossible
                                to
                                raise
                                their heart level. The heart level of cows and goats, however, is increased through
                                successful
                                milking,
                                which
                                can be done any time, including while they are sleeping. The advantage of milking after
                                8pm is that
                                animals
                                will
                                never walk away and be out of range.

                                Sometimes animals will refuse to go inside, moving around like they would during the day
                                even at
                                midnight.
                                This
                                can be fixed by leaving and re-entering the farm, and the animals will be automatically
                                moved
                                inside.
                                Exiting
                                the barn and re-entering is another option; the animals will change position randomly.
                            </p>
